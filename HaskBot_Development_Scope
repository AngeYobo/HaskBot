✔ Implement paper trading mode (simulate trades without real money)
✔ Add WebSocket for real-time price updates

3️⃣ AI-Driven Trading Strategy
📌 Goal: Enhance trade execution with AI/ML-based decision-making.
🛠 Tasks:
✔ Collect historical market data for AI model training
✔ Implement machine learning model for price prediction (LSTM, reinforcement learning)
✔ Train AI to detect bullish & bearish patterns
✔ Fine-tune strategy with backtesting & forward testing
✔ Implement AI-based position sizing & portfolio optimization

🔹 Phase 2: Web-Based User Platform
4️⃣ User Dashboard & Trading Interface
📌 Goal: Provide an intuitive platform where users can manage their bots & trades.
🛠 Tasks:
✔ Web dashboard with React, Next.js, or Vue.js
✔ User authentication & API key management
✔ Live price charts (Candlestick charts with TradingView API)
✔ Trade execution interface (manual & automated trading options)
✔ Bot customization (users can adjust AI settings & indicators)
✔ Portfolio tracking (show open positions, balance, PnL)

5️⃣ Alerts, Notifications & Logs
📌 Goal: Keep users informed about market movements and trade execution.
🛠 Tasks:
✔ Implement Telegram & Slack alerts for buy/sell signals
✔ Send email & SMS notifications for order execution & risk management
✔ Store trade logs & performance reports
✔ Provide a real-time activity feed

🔹 Phase 3: Deployment & Scaling
6️⃣ Security & Compliance
📌 Goal: Ensure secure, compliant, and high-performance operations.
🛠 Tasks:
✔ Encrypt API keys (store securely in a vault)
✔ Implement 2FA & role-based access control
✔ Monitor API rate limits to prevent account bans
✔ Comply with exchange security policies (Binance, Kraken, etc.)

7️⃣ Deployment & Cloud Infrastructure
📌 Goal: Deploy the platform in a scalable and reliable manner.
🛠 Tasks:
✔ Dockerize HaskBot for easy deployment
✔ Deploy on AWS/GCP/Azure/DigitalOcean (server or Kubernetes cluster)
✔ Implement auto-scaling & fault tolerance
✔ Store user data in PostgreSQL / Firebase / MongoDB
✔ Real-time data streaming with WebSockets

🔹 Phase 4: Expansion & Future Features
📌 Goal: Grow the platform with additional features.
🛠 Tasks:
✔ Support more exchanges (OKX, Huobi, KuCoin)
✔ Add DeFi trading strategies (Uniswap, PancakeSwap integration)
✔ Enable copy trading & social trading
✔ Implement AI-powered trade insights & sentiment analysis
