## 1. Introduction

Cryptocurrency day trading involves the rapid buying and selling of cryptocurrencies to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations. Successful day traders often rely on technical indicators and order book analysis to make informed trading decisions. HaskBot aims to provide day traders with a powerful and customizable tool for monitoring and analyzing market data in real-time.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of HaskBot are as follows:

- Real-Time Data Monitoring: HaskBot will retrieve real-time market data, including price, volume, order book, and trading indicators, from the Binance cryptocurrency exchange.

- Technical Indicator Calculation: HaskBot will calculate and display various technical indicators, such as Moving Averages (MAs), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, Fibonacci retracement levels, and Ichimoku Cloud.

- Buy and Sell Signal Generation: Based on the values of these indicators, HaskBot will generate buy and sell signals to assist day traders in making timely and informed trading decisions.

- Risk Management: HaskBot will implement risk management strategies, including stop-loss and take-profit orders, to mitigate potential losses.

- Real-Time Order Book Monitoring: HaskBot will provide real-time order book data, allowing traders to assess market depth and liquidity.

## 3. Features

Key features of HaskBot include:

- **Real-Time Data**: HaskBot will continuously fetch real-time data from Binance's API to ensure up-to-the-second information.

- **Indicator Customization**: Traders can configure their preferred technical indicators, timeframes, and signal thresholds.

- **WebSocket Integration**: HaskBot will use WebSocket connections to receive live updates from Binance, enabling fast and efficient data streaming.

- **Buy and Sell Alerts**: When a significant buy or sell signal is detected, HaskBot will generate alerts for traders.

- **Risk Management Tools**: Users can set stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage their trading risk.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: HaskBot will have a simple and intuitive command-line interface for easy interaction.

## 4. Architecture

HaskBot will be built using Haskell, a functional programming language known for its strong type system and reliability. The architecture will consist of the following components:

- **Data Fetcher**: Responsible for retrieving real-time market data and order book data from the Binance API.

- **Indicator Engine**: Calculates and updates various technical indicators based on incoming data.

- **Signal Generator**: Generates buy and sell signals based on indicator values and user-defined thresholds.

- **Risk Manager**: Implements risk management strategies, including stop-loss and take-profit orders.

- **WebSocket Connector**: Maintains WebSocket connections to receive real-time updates.

- **User Interface**: Provides a command-line interface for user interaction and alerts.

## 5. Technical Indicators

HaskBot will support a range of technical indicators, including but not limited to:

- Moving Averages (SMA and EMA)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Bollinger Bands
- MACD
- Stochastic Oscillator
- Fibonacci retracement levels
- Ichimoku Cloud

## 6. Risk Management

HaskBot will incorporate risk management features to protect traders' capital, including setting stop-loss and take-profit levels. Traders can define these levels to automatically exit positions when certain conditions are met.

## 7. Data Sources

HaskBot will rely on Binance's API for real-time market data, order book data, and WebSocket updates.

## 8. Deployment

HaskBot can be deployed on a server or cloud platform to run continuously. Users will need to configure API keys for Binance and customize their indicator settings.

## 9. Conclusion

HaskBot aims to empower cryptocurrency day traders with a robust and customizable tool for real-time monitoring of technical indicators and order book data. By leveraging Haskell's strengths in reliability and functional programming, HaskBot offers a high-performance solution for traders seeking an edge in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading.
